The following is the format for the mesh, exported by the blender_exporter.py format:

1.  16-bit unsigned short: Amount of verts
2.  16-bit unsigned short: Amount of indices

For each vert specified by #1:
32-bit float: x, y, z, normal-x, normal-y, normal-z, u, v
totals: 256 bits per vertex.

For each index specified by #2:
16-bit short: index
is an index into the vertex array.
